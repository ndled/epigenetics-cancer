Notes for Running:
1) Ensure your hg19 data is in your working directory. 
2) This will likely take ~2 hours to run through each chr.

Function Descriptions

delete.na: Function removes rows with that have more than n missing values for either the forward or reverse sections of the merged dataframe.

pval_meandif_calculation: Calculates pvalue with wilcoxsign_test and the mean difference between the forward and reverse strands.

clust_hist: Creates a histogram of the length of CpG clusters. Histograms are saved as {dfName} Histogram of Cluster Length.jpg in the working directory.

cluster_hist_zoomed: Creates a histogram of the length of a cpg cluster, removing clusters > 100 in length. Histograms are saved as {dfName}zoomed.jpg in the working directory.

grouping: Creates groups with ungrouped items assigned to group 0

size_of_df: Returns the size of a data frame when filtered under certain conditions

load_in_data: Loads in chr data and merges for and rev tables.

filter_data: filters the data at pval < 0.05 and meandiff >0.4 or  (pval< .13 & meandiff >.4 & groupNumber != 0)

composite: Runs through all of the previous funtions
